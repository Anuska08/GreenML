# ðŸŒ±âš¡ GreenML Dashboard â€“ Smart Appliance Energy Predictor

The **GreenML Dashboard** is a sustainable AI initiative that leverages **machine learning** and **green computing** to accurately predict household appliance energy consumption based on indoor and outdoor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, occupancy, and COâ‚‚ levels.

> What sets this project apart is its integration with the `codecarbon` library to track the **carbon emissions** produced during model training, promoting **eco-conscious AI practices**.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Python** â€“ Data handling and model development  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- **codecarbon** â€“ Carbon footprint measurement  
- **seaborn** & **matplotlib** â€“ Visual analytics  
- **Streamlit** â€“ Interactive web dashboard  

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

âœ… Model performance comparison (MAE, RÂ², COâ‚‚ emissions)  
âœ… Heatmap showing top 10 feature correlations  
âœ… Single input prediction and batch CSV-based predictions  
âœ… Energy usage and environmental impact visualizations  
âœ… Streamlit-powered UI â€“ **ready for public deployment**
